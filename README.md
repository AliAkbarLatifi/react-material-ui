# React + Material-UI

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [React](https://reactjs.org) project.
With [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app) at its core, you can use it to bootstrap your projects and development environment with the same tooling.
It comes bundled with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router).

## Features

- Bootstrapped with Create React App, the same tooling works out-of-the-box
- Scaffolding incorporates Google Material Design principles through Material-UI
- Robust routing with React Router including error handling

## Get started

The project is up and running after just 4 commands.

### Clone the repository

The command `git clone` is a [Git](https://www.git-scm.com) command-line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.
The `<directory>` option is the name of a new directory to clone into, replace it with your project’s name.

```
git clone https://github.com/AliAkbarLatifi/react-material-ui.git <directory>
```

### Install the dependencies

The command `cd`, also known as `chdir` (**ch**ange **dir**ectory), is a command-line OS shell command used to change the current working directory.
The `<directory>` option is the name of the new working directory, replace it with your project’s name.

```
cd <directory>
```

The command `yarn install` is a [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) command-line utility which is used to install all dependencies for a project.
This is most commonly used when you have just checked out code for a project, or when another developer on the project has added a new dependency that you need to pick up.

```
yarn install
```

### Run the app

The command `yarn start` is another Yarn command-line utility which is used to run the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

```
yarn start
```
